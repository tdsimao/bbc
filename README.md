# bbc

## Synopsis

`bbc` is a tiny utility that checks some basic properties of you bibtex
files, orders the entries in an alphabetical order and style them in a uniform
way.

## Usage

`./prettybib.py --input=<bib_file> --output=<out_file>`

The formated bibtex printed the `<out_file>` file, error messages on the
standard error output. Missing fields which are required for the particular
types of entries are assigned the `TODO` value.

If you toggle option `--try-fix`, it will try to find missing ISSN and other
informations about journals (from [DBpedia](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/)) or ISBN
and other information for books (from [Google Books](books.google.com)).
